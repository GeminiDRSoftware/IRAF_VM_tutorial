Shutting down the VM
********************

* You can shut down the VM by clicking the close button (|close_button|) on the
  upper left of the console window, or from ``Machine`` in the menu bar. To
  shut it down completely, you can choose ``Send the shutdown signal`` / ``ACPI
  shutdown``, or you can ``Save the machine state`` to resume later where you
  left off.

* While the VM is running in the background, it will probably use a few percent
  of a CPU core, which may drain your laptop battery faster than usual.
