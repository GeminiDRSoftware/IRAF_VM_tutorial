.. _shutdown:

Shutting down the VM
********************

* You can shut down the VM by clicking the close (``x``) icon on the upper left
  of the console window, or from ``Machine`` in the menu bar. To shut it down
  completely, you can choose ``Send the shutdown signal`` / ``ACPI shutdown``,
  or you can ``Save the machine state`` to resume later where you left off.

* While the VM is running in the background, it will probably use a few percent
  of a CPU core, which may drain your laptop battery faster than usual.
